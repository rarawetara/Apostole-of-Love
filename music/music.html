                <h1>APOSTLE OF LOVE PT.1</h1>
                <p>NEOCLASSICAL ORATORIO "THE APOSTLE OF LOVE" BY ANATOLII DOLESKO IS A LARGE-SCALE OPUS IN TWO SECTIONS THAT CONTINUES THE BEST TRADITIONS OF THE ORATORIO GENRE AND SYMPHONIC ROCK. THE POLYSTYLISTIC COMBINATION OF THE NEOCLASSICAL ORATORIO GENRE AND ROCK MUSIC IS ORGANICALLY INTERTWINED WITH THE BIBLICAL PLOT OF THE WORK, WHICH INCLUDES THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS. THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SACRED LATIN TEXTS OF THE MASS (ORDINARE) WITH BIBLICAL SUBJECTS CREATE A MULTI-LAYERED AND INDIVIDUAL VISION OF THE AUTHOR....</p>
                <p class="additional-text">The first part consists of six numbers lasting 40 minutes, in which events based on the biblical story of the New Testament are shown. The oratorio begins with a majestic prelude, followed by variations on the theme of the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, Presentation, and Finding in the Temple.</p>

                <p>THE NEOCLASSICAL ORATORIO "THE APOSTLE OF LOVE" CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS WITH A TOTAL DURATION OF 90 MINUTES. THE WORK BEGINS WITH THE PRELUDE, WHICH ACTS AS A SOLEMN OVERTURE, IN WHICH THE BIBLICAL STORY OF THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE IS TOLD. THE FIRST PART IS PERFORMED NON-STOP FOR 45 MINUTES, INCLUDING SEVEN NUMBERS BASED ON THE MUSICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT OF THE BIBLE...</p>
                <p class="additional-text">The second part consists of eight numbers lasting 45 minutes, in which events based on the biblical story of the New Testament are shown. At the beginning of the second part, a number called "Christmas" is performed. The oratorio ends with the pompous final postlude "The Second Coming", in which a symphonic-choral sound and an expressive guitar solo are vividly combined.</p>
